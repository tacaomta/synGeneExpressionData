### Experimental Procedure

**Step 1: Ground-Truth Network Generation**
Generate synthetic ground-truth regulatory networks using *Experiment 19*, which simulates gene expression over 100 time steps.

**Step 2: Model Training and Data Generation**
Train the model on the synthetic data produced in Step 1. Then, use the trained model to generate new gene expression data and evaluate its quality. This step corresponds to *Experiment 21*.

**Step 3: Ground-Truth Comparison**
Compare the generated data against the ground-truth networks to assess similarity and biological relevance. This is conducted through *Experiment 20*.
